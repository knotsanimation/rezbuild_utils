# rezbuild_utils

Python library providing utilities to build rez packages.

```python
import rezbuild_utils
help(rezbuild_utils)
```

# prerequisites

It is mostly expected to be used during a rez-build (and as such expecting
the rez build environment variable to be set.)

# tests

Assuming the package has been build or deployed at least once :

```shell
rez-test rezbuild_utils
```
